#Paragraph Generating Model
The aim of the project is to make use of OpenAI tools to create a paragraph generating model on a working web platform. In the project when a user writes or enter the heading for the para he/she wants the powerfull model porcesses it and completes it for him and the result is printed upon the web page itself. 



##The main model is made with OpenAI's Davinci model and it is run on a web application library called Streamlit 
### To start the program you need to write [ streamlit run (application name i.e. in this case is webapp.py) ] code in your command prompt
I will provide screen shots of the project for easier understanding as writing command lines might be wast of time
